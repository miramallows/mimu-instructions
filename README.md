Instructions for setting up "Your Own Mimu" tier on Patreon.

### thank you!
thank you so much for pledging and supporting me in my passion project. the costs of this tier goes directly to **making your experience** even better through:
 - dedicated resources for your bot in its **own** container
 - comes with one key a month (to activate premium of your bot)
 - easy data transfer between your bot and existing bots
 - better uptime, stability, latency, and features will be refined
 - extra customisability like editing your profile picture and username and having control of your bot account.

in order for **me (iara)** to be able to set up your bot to start running mimu, you have to take a few steps. this guide will serve as that.

### creating your bot account
1. head to [the discord developer portal](https://canary.discord.com/developers/applications).

2. you should see something like this. at the top right corner, click **new application**:

3. alrighty! now you should see something like this. name your new bot friend with a cute name.

4. now you should see a control panel of your application. this is the place you'll be able to change it to be a bot and be able to edit its details in the future. go ahead and upload a profile picture if you'd like. i'm just gonna keep mine to "mom" for now :')

5. on the right of the page, you'll see a nav bar. click "Bot", then "Add Bot", then confirm:

6. Alright, we're almost done. now scroll a little bit to uncover a section called "Privileged Gateway Intents". you're gonna need to activate the "Guild Members" one. Remember to save your changes!

7. Okay! Now you just have to fetch your Client ID and Token and drop it to iara#0001's DMs (if you don't have access to my DMs yet, poke me in talk-to-devs and drop me a friend request). once you've done so, it will take me up to 3 days to set up (usually less than a day).

client id (need to go back to general information on the nav bar). not to be confused with client secret:
