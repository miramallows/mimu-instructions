# mimu-instructions
instructions for setting up the "my own mimu" donator tier

### â™¡ a whole-hearted thank you!
thank you so much for pledging and supporting me in my passion project. the costs of this tier goes directly to **making your experience** even better through:
 - dedicated resources for your bot in its **own** container - making updates smoother & minimal downtime for YOU and your server; faster updates & just a bot that runs faster than main mimu
 - comes with one key a month (to activate premium of your bot)
 - easy data transfer between your bot and existing bots
 - extra customisability like editing your profile picture and username and having control of your bot account

in order for **our staff** to be able to set up your bot to start running mimu, you have to take a few steps. this guide will serve as that.

### creating your bot account
1. head to [the discord developer portal](https://canary.discord.com/developers/applications).

2. you should see something like this. at the top right corner, click **new application**:

3. alrighty! now you should see something like this. name your new bot friend with a cute name.

4. now you should see a control panel of your application. this is the place you'll be able to change it to be a bot and be able to edit its details in the future. go ahead and upload a profile picture if you'd like. i'm just gonna keep mine to "mom" for now :')

5. on the right of the page, you'll see a nav bar. click "Bot", then "Add Bot", then confirm:

6. once you've done so, your page should look like this. make sure to leave "public bot" on for now - this is because i have to invite your bot to the mimu emoji server as mimu has some custom emojis it uses. i strongly recommend switching it back off when i'm done setting up.

7. Alright, we're almost done. now scroll a little bit to uncover a section called "Privileged Gateway Intents". you're gonna need to activate the "Guild Members" and "Message Content" ones. Remember to save your changes!

8. Okay! Now you just have to fetch your Client ID (or can be known as Application ID) and Token, make a private thread (instructions are in the mom-setup channel) and paste it there. Once you've done so, it will take me up to 3 days to set up (usually less than 24 hours).

client id (need to go back to general information on the nav bar). not to be confused with client secret:
